		-*-By sending minimum information to the server and getting maximum information.
		
		Limitations=>
		
		--We can not send large information by using GET method.
		--It has 2083 characters limit.
		--That means the url should be in between this limit.
		--As the url is readable :: so there can be security issue.
		--It will show the username and password in the url itself.
		--So we should not send the secure information by using get.
		--We can pass only text information.That means string.
		--Binary data can not be passed (like : mp3, mp4, img)
		
	-POST   
		--used to communicate between client and server.
		--It provides security. 
		--That means it does not pass information in the url().
		--Information is get passed in the  Http-Body.
		--Their is no length limitation.
		--No security issue.
		--We can pass binary data (like: mp3,mp4,img).
