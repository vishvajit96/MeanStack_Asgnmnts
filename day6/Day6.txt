	* Before creating any project , first go to terminal and type "npm init"
		-this initialize the project.
		-it creates the package.json file 
		-this json file indicates that this is an nodeJS project.
		-This is more important to identify our project.
		
		
	* Modules :
		-There are 3 types of modules in NodejS.
		1) Local Module.
		2) Internal Module.
		3) External Module.
		
		-Every program is module in nodejs.
		-Modules are used to achieve madularity.
		-modules are also known as Package,Library.
		-Modules are on server side .
		-Its not available in client sid(i.e. in HTML).
		-
		
		
	* How Modules Work in NodeJS:
		-To make the program as module-> go to the end of program and write there "module.exports";
		-By using this we can use current program in anoher program.
		-Now to import it another program->
			require("./modulename")
		-this ./ indicates that module is Local Module. that means our created module.
		
		-require("http") =>this internal module. means inbuild module.
		
		-How to exports more than one functionality:
			-module.exports.variable_name(this could be anything)=variable_name(this should be previously defined in program);
		
		
	# Creating the server :
		-Here we use internal module.
			const http=request("http");
		-http.createServer((req,res)=>{});
		- .listen(5600);                        //url is created.
