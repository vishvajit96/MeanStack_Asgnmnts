	# JQuerry ($) :
		-Jquerry is javscript library.
		-Which is used at client side.
		-JQuerry is enhanced version of DOM.
		-All the things we do in jquerry it can be also be done in DOM. 
		-But jquerry provides usefull methods.
		-it includes only methods.
			--eg: innerHTML="" replaced by html().
		-It simplifies the document operations.
		-It dosent with browser bydefault.
		-we have to call it explicitly in our project.
		-basic purpose was to provide consistancy.
		-that means your program works in each type of browser in same way.
		-it provides cross-browser. this is main importance of it.
		-nowadays angular takes over the jquerry.
		-type jquerry cdn and go to jquerry cdn. use 3.x version.
		-and copy the minified url in script tag.
		-this minified version saves the bandwidth of user.
		-you can check wether jquerry is added in project :go to source, or in consol tab use $.ajax('url').
		
		
		# How to find element by using jquerry:
			-$();
			
			-$("#id1");
			-above line equivalent to :document.querySelector('#id1');
			
			-$("#id1").css('color','green');
			-it is similar to document.querrySelector('#id1').style.color="red';
			
			-$("#id1").hide();   => its hide the block. like display=none.
			
			-we can mix up the programs. like we can write DOM and jquerry in same project.
			
			- $("parent div:nth-child(1)")  OR
			  $("parent :nth-child(1)")
			 => This will access the 1st child of parent ID.
			 - Like this we can access any child of any element or any id.
			
			
		# Working with AJAX :
			-$.ajax(url).done((data1) => {
				consol.log(data1);
				myDOMoperationHere(data1);
				});
			
			-It gives JSON as a default response.
			-Here we dont need to parse it aslo. JQuerry internally parse this JSON file and gives us a structured data.
